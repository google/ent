# ðŸŒ³ Ent

Ent (named after the [Ent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent) species from _The
Lord of the Rings_ by J. R. R. Tolkien) is an experimental universal, scalable,
general purpose, Content-Addressable Store (CAS) to explore verifiable data
structures, policies and graphs.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Content-Addressability

Ent encourages a model in which files are referred to by their hash (as a proxy
for their content), instead of which server they happen to be located (which is
what a URL normally is for).

For example, instead of referring to the image below by its URL
`https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew-Caravaggo_%281599-1600%29.jpg/405px-The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew-Caravaggo_%281599-1600%29.jpg`,
in Ent it would be referred to by its hash
`sha256:f3e737f4d50fbf6bb6053e3b8c72d6bf7f1a7229aacf2e9b4c97e9dd27cb1dcf`.

The hash is a stable cryptographic identifier for the actual data that is
contained in the file, and does not depend on where the file is hosted, or under
what path it is available. If at some point in the future the file were to
disappear from the original location and be made available at a different
location, its hash would stay the same.

Additionally, using hashes to refer to objects is useful for security and
trustworthiness: if someone sends you the hash of a file to download (e.g. a
program to install on your computer), you can be sure that, by resolving that
hash to an actual file via Ent, the resulting file is exactly the one that the
sender intended, without having to trust the Ent index or the server where the
file is ultimately hosted.

## Installation

The Ent CLI can be built and installed with the following command, after having
cloned this repository locally:

```bash
go install ./cmd/ent
```

And is then available via the binary called `ent`:

```bash
ent help
```

## Examples

In order to fetch a file with a given hash, the `ent get` subcommand can be
used.

You can try the following command in your terminal, which fetches the text of
the _Treasure Island_ book:

```console
$ ent get sha256:4c350163715b7b1d0fc3bcbf11bfffc0cf2d107f69253f237111a7480809e192 | head

Title: Treasure Island
```

The Ent CLI queries the default Ent index
(https://github.com/tiziano88/ent-index) to resolve the hash to a URL, and then
fetches the file at that URL, and also verifies that it corresponds to the
expected hash. It first buffers the entire file internally in order to verify
its hash, and only prints it to stdout if it does match the expected hash.

You can also manually double check that the returned file does in fact
correspond to the expected hash:

```console
$ ent get sha256:4c350163715b7b1d0fc3bcbf11bfffc0cf2d107f69253f237111a7480809e192 | sha256sum
4c350163715b7b1d0fc3bcbf11bfffc0cf2d107f69253f237111a7480809e192  -
```

## Index

An Ent index stores an entry for each hash, listing one or more "traditional"
URLs which provide the file in question.

It is serialized as a Git repository with a directory structure corresponding to
the hash of each entry, and a JSON file for each entry that lists one or more
URLs at which the object may be found.

The directory path is obtained by grouping sets of two digits from the hash, and
creating a nested folder for each of them; this is in order to limit the number
of files or directories inside each directory, since that would otherwise not
scale when there are millions of entries in the index.

For instance, the file with hash
`sha256:4c350163715b7b1d0fc3bcbf11bfffc0cf2d107f69253f237111a7480809e192` is
stored in the Ent index under the file
`/sha256/4c/35/01/63/71/5b/7b/1d/0f/c3/bc/bf/11/bf/ff/c0/cf/2d/10/7f/69/25/3f/23/71/11/a7/48/08/09/e1/92/entry.json`,
which contains the following entry:

https://github.com/tiziano88/ent-index/blob/fddaa4b78ec4f4ba1e2c1e3e1c0b5ae9b06565e2/sha256/4c/35/01/63/71/5b/7b/1d/0f/c3/bc/bf/11/bf/ff/c0/cf/2d/10/7f/69/25/3f/23/71/11/a7/48/08/09/e1/92/entry.json#L1

Note that the Ent index only stores URLs, not actual data, under the assumptions
that URLs will keep pointing to the same file forever.

The client querying the index is responsible to verify that the target file
still corresponds to the expected hash; if this validation fails, it means that
the URL was moved to point to a diferent file after it was added to the Ent
index.

## Updating the index

Currently, entries may be added to the default index by creating a comment in
https://github.com/tiziano88/ent-index/issues/1 containing the URL of the file
to index. A GitHub actions is then triggered that fetches the file, creates an
appropriate entry in the index, and commits that back into the git repository.

You can try this by picking a URL of an existing file, and creating a comment in
https://github.com/tiziano88/ent-index/issues/1 ; after a few minutes, the
GitHub action should post another comment in reply, confirming that the entry
was correctly incorporated in the index, and printing out its hash, which may
then be used with the Ent CLI as above.

If the URL stops pointing to the file that was originally indexed, the Ent CLI
will detect that and produce an error.

There is no process for cleaning up / fixing inconsistent entries in the index
(yet).
